  summary: Deep learning library for solving differential equations

  description: |
    DeepXDE is a deep learning library for solving differential equations on top of TensorFlow.
    Use DeepXDE if you need a deep learning library that
    solves partial differential equations (PDEs),
    solves integro-differential equations (IDEs),
    solves fractional partial differential equations (fPDEs),
    solves inverse problems for differential equations,
    approximates functions from a dataset with/without constraints,
    approximates functions from multi-fidelity data,
    and approximates operators.
