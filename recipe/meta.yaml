  summary: Deep learning library for solving differential equations

  description: |
    DeepXDE is a deep learning library on top of TensorFlow. Use DeepXDE if you need a deep learning library that
    solves forward and inverse partial differential equations (PDEs) via physics-informed neural network (PINN),
    solves forward and inverse integro-differential equations (IDEs) via PINN,
    solves forward and inverse fractional partial differential equations (fPDEs) via fractional PINN (fPINN),
    approximates functions from multi-fidelity data via multi-fidelity NN (MFNN),
    approximates nonlinear operators via deep operator network (DeepONet),
    approximates functions from a dataset with/without constraints.
